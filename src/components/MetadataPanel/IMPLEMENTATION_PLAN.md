# MetadataPanel Implementation Plan

## Current Progress and Issues

### Fixed:
- ✅ Syntax errors in useMetadataContext.ts
- ✅ Basic structure of MetadataPanel component
- ✅ Tag operations (state, fetch, mutations)
- ✅ Content validation utilities with proper typing
- ✅ Error handling system with standardized approach
- ✅ Type definitions for validation and metadata
- ✅ Created utility functions for validation results
- ✅ Implemented MetadataQueryProvider with React Query
- ✅ Updated error handling with utility wrappers
- ✅ Enhanced useSourceMetadata with better error handling
- ✅ Improved usePanelState with toggle functionality

### Current Issues:
1. ✅ Fixed syntax errors in useMetadataContext.ts
2. 🔄 Test files still using outdated mock implementations
3. 🔄 Some components not fully integrated with context
4. ✅ Enhanced error handling implementation with wrappers

## Updated Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Critical Errors (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Fix syntax errors in useMetadataContext.ts
- ✅ Create comprehensive content validation utilities
- ✅ Implement centralized error handling system
- ✅ Update validation result types with utility functions
- ✅ Create test utilities for validation

### Phase 2: Provider Implementation (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Create a proper MetadataContext provider for production use
- ✅ Implement React Query integration in the provider
- ✅ Update components to use MetadataContext consistently
- ✅ Ensure content validation is consistently applied
- 🔄 Update test infrastructure with new provider patterns

### Phase 3: Feature Enhancement (CURRENT)
- ✅ Enhance error handling with utility wrappers
- ✅ Improve usePanelState hook with toggle functionality
- ✅ Enhance useSourceMetadata with better error handling
- 🔄 Complete tag operations with proper validation
- 🔄 Implement external source validation and operations
- 🔄 Add improved ontology term support
- 🔄 Unify external source handling across components

### Phase 4: UI Enhancement
- 🔄 Finalize UI components with proper error states
- 🔄 Complete metadata panel with all sections
- 🔄 Add error boundaries for more robust failure handling
- 🔄 Implement loading states and skeletons
- 🔄 Add proper responsiveness to all components

### Phase 5: Testing and Quality Assurance
- 🔄 Ensure all tests pass with updated implementations
- 🔄 Add comprehensive test coverage for new functionality
- 🔄 Verify error handling works as expected
- 🔄 Test performance with large datasets
- 🔄 Test edge cases with invalid content IDs

### Phase 6: Documentation and Optimization
- 🔄 Complete documentation for all components and hooks
- 🔄 Add code examples for common use cases
- 🔄 Optimize performance for large datasets
- 🔄 Implement caching strategies for metadata

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Fix syntax errors in useMetadataContext.ts
2. ✅ Enhance error handling with utility wrappers
3. ✅ Update usePanelState for better UX
4. ✅ Enhance useSourceMetadata with better error handling
5. 🔄 Complete the implementation of tag validation hooks
6. 🔄 Implement external source validation components
7. 🔄 Add ontology term handling with validation
8. 🔄 Update test infrastructure to match new implementation
9. 🔄 Document usage patterns for the MetadataPanel

## Technical Debt to Address

- ⚠️ Long files that need refactoring (useMetadataOperations.ts is 384 lines)
- ⚠️ Inconsistent hook patterns between old and new implementations
- ⚠️ Duplicate error handling logic
- ⚠️ Inadequate test coverage
- ⚠️ Multiple error handling approaches in different parts of the codebase
