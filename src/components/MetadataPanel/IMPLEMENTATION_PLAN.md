# MetadataPanel Implementation Plan

## Current Progress and Issues

### Fixed:
- ✅ Syntax errors in useMetadataContext.ts
- ✅ Basic structure of MetadataPanel component
- ✅ Tag operations (state, fetch, mutations)
- ✅ Content validation utilities with proper typing
- ✅ Error handling system with standardized approach
- ✅ Type definitions for validation and metadata
- ✅ Created utility functions for validation results
- ✅ Implemented MetadataQueryProvider with React Query
- ✅ Updated error handling with utility wrappers
- ✅ Enhanced useSourceMetadata with React Query integration

### Current Issues:
1. ✅ Fixed syntax errors in useMetadataContext.ts
2. 🔄 Test files still using outdated mock implementations
3. 🔄 Some components not fully integrated with context
4. 🔄 Need to complete the error handling implementation

## Updated Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Critical Errors (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Fix syntax errors in useMetadataContext.ts
- ✅ Create comprehensive content validation utilities
- ✅ Implement centralized error handling system
- ✅ Update validation result types with utility functions
- ✅ Create test utilities for validation

### Phase 2: Provider Implementation (CURRENT)
- ✅ Create a proper MetadataContext provider for production use
- ✅ Implement React Query integration in the provider
- ✅ Update components to use MetadataContext consistently
- ✅ Ensure content validation is consistently applied
- 🔄 Update test infrastructure with new provider patterns

### Phase 3: Feature Completion (NEXT)
- 🔄 Complete tag operations with proper validation
- 🔄 Implement external source validation and operations
- 🔄 Add improved ontology term support
- 🔄 Finalize UI components with proper error states
- 🔄 Complete metadata panel with all sections

### Phase 4: Testing and Quality Assurance
- 🔄 Ensure all tests pass with updated implementations
- 🔄 Add comprehensive test coverage for new functionality
- 🔄 Verify error handling works as expected
- 🔄 Test performance with large datasets
- 🔄 Test edge cases with invalid content IDs

### Phase 5: Documentation and Optimization
- 🔄 Complete documentation for all components and hooks
- 🔄 Add code examples for common use cases
- 🔄 Optimize performance for large datasets
- 🔄 Implement caching strategies for metadata

## Next Steps

1. Complete the implementation of tag validation hooks
2. Update the error handling in components
3. Add the remaining features to the MetadataPanel
4. Update test infrastructure to match new implementation
5. Document usage patterns for the MetadataPanel

## Technical Debt to Address

- ⚠️ Long files that need refactoring
- ⚠️ Inconsistent hook patterns
- ⚠️ Duplicate error handling logic
- ⚠️ Inadequate test coverage
- ⚠️ Multiple error handling approaches in different parts of the codebase
