# MetadataPanel Implementation Plan

## Current Progress and Issues

### Fixed:
- ✅ Syntax errors in useMetadataContext.ts
- ✅ Basic structure of MetadataPanel component
- ✅ Tag operations (state, fetch, mutations)
- ✅ Content validation utilities with proper typing
- ✅ Error handling system with standardized approach
- ✅ Type definitions for validation and metadata
- ✅ Created utility functions for validation results

### Current Issues:
1. ✅ Fixed syntax errors in useMetadataContext.ts
2. 🔄 Test files still using outdated mock implementations
3. 🔄 Inconsistent error handling across components
4. 🔄 Missing proper context provider implementation in several components
5. 🔄 Component tests failing due to context issues

## Updated Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Critical Errors (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Fix syntax errors in useMetadataContext.ts
- ✅ Create comprehensive content validation utilities
- ✅ Implement centralized error handling system
- ✅ Update validation result types with utility functions
- ✅ Create test utilities for validation

### Phase 2: Test Infrastructure (CURRENT)
- ✅ Create MockMetadataProvider for testing
- 🔄 Update test mocks to use new provider
- 🔄 Fix remaining test errors by updating test utilities
- 🔄 Create standardized test patterns for components using context
- 🔄 Add test helpers for error scenarios

### Phase 3: Context Implementation
- 🔄 Create a proper MetadataContext provider for production use
- 🔄 Implement proper error handling with context
- 🔄 Update components to use MetadataContext consistently
- 🔄 Add provider to application hierarchy
- 🔄 Ensure content validation is consistently applied

### Phase 4: Feature Completion
- 🔄 Complete tag operations with proper validation
- 🔄 Implement external source validation and operations
- 🔄 Add ontology term support
- 🔄 Finalize UI components with proper error states
- 🔄 Complete metadata panel with all sections

### Phase 5: Testing and Quality Assurance
- 🔄 Ensure all tests pass with updated implementations
- 🔄 Add comprehensive test coverage for new functionality
- 🔄 Verify error handling works as expected
- 🔄 Test performance with large datasets
- 🔄 Test edge cases with invalid content IDs

### Phase 6: Documentation and Optimization
- 🔄 Complete documentation for all components and hooks
- 🔄 Add code examples for common use cases
- 🔄 Optimize performance for large datasets
- 🔄 Implement caching strategies for metadata

## Next Steps

1. Complete the MockMetadataProvider implementation with test cases
2. Update all test files to use the new provider
3. Create a production MetadataContext provider
4. Fix component integration with the context
5. Ensure validation utilities are used consistently

## Technical Debt to Address

- ⚠️ Long files that need refactoring
- ⚠️ Inconsistent hook patterns
- ⚠️ Duplicate error handling logic
- ⚠️ Inadequate test coverage
- ⚠️ Multiple error handling approaches in different parts of the codebase
