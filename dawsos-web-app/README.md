# DawsOS Web Application

DawsOS is an AI-augmented knowledge management system designed to enhance the way users interact with information. Built with React (using Vite), TypeScript, Supabase, and OpenAI GPT-4, this application aims to provide a seamless experience for managing knowledge sources and templates.

## Features

- **AI Integration**: Leverage OpenAI GPT-4 for intelligent insights and suggestions.
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Utilize Supabase for real-time data synchronization and user authentication.
- **Modular Components**: Built with reusable React components for a consistent user interface.
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript ensures type safety across the application, reducing runtime errors.
