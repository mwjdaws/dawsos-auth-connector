# Tag System Usage Guide

This document provides guidance on how to use the tag system effectively in the DawsOS application.

## Getting Started

The tag system in DawsOS allows you to organize and categorize your knowledge content. Tags can be:

1. **Automatically generated** based on content analysis
2. **Manually created** by users
3. **Standardized** using tag types

## Automatic Tag Generation

The system can analyze your content and suggest relevant tags:

1. Navigate to the **Dashboard** and select the "Tag Generator" tab
2. Enter or paste your content in the text area
3. Click "Generate Tags" (or "Suggest Tags")
4. Review the generated tags
5. Click "Save Tags" to associate them with your content

**Tips:**
- Provide substantial content (at least a paragraph) for better tag suggestions
- You can regenerate tags if the suggestions aren't relevant
- Tags are stored temporarily until you save them

## Manual Tag Creation

To create tags manually:

1. Go to the "Manual Tags" tab in the Tag Generator interface
2. Enter a tag name in the input field
3. Select a tag type from the dropdown (optional)
4. Click "Add" to create the tag

**Tips:**
- Use descriptive but concise tag names
- Consistent naming conventions improve searchability
- Tags are immediately saved to the database

## Managing Tags

### Viewing Tags

All tags associated with a piece of content can be viewed in:
- The Metadata panel when viewing content
- The Tag Generator interface in the Dashboard

### Deleting Tags

To delete a tag:
1. Find the tag in the tag list
2. Click the "X" icon on the tag
3. Confirm deletion if prompted

### Tag Types

Tag types help categorize tags by their purpose:
- **Topic**: Subject matter of the content
- **Format**: Type of content (article, guide, reference)
- **Status**: Current state (draft, reviewed, published)
- **Technical**: Technical aspects covered

## Troubleshooting

### Tags Not Generating

If automatic tag generation fails:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Ensure the content is substantial enough
3. Try regenerating after a few minutes

### Tags Not Saving

If tags fail to save:
1. Verify you're authenticated (logged in)
2. Check if you have permission to edit the content
3. Ensure the content has a valid ID (not a temporary ID)

### Missing Related Tags

If related tags aren't appearing:
1. This feature might be disabled or experiencing issues
2. Try refreshing the page
3. Tags need to be saved first before related tags appear

## Best Practices

1. **Be Consistent**: Use a consistent tagging strategy
2. **Be Specific**: Specific tags are more useful than general ones
3. **Use Multiple Tags**: Apply several relevant tags to improve findability
4. **Review Generated Tags**: Always review and refine automatically generated tags
5. **Use Tag Types**: Categorize tags by type to improve organization
